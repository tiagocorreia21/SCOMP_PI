## Sprint 2

Figure Code Simulation System

- As a show drone operator, I want to simulate the execution of a figure to ensure drones do not collide before adding the figure to the
library.

## Sprint 3

Hybrid Drone Simulation with Shared Memory and Advanced Synchronization

- As a show drone operator, I want the simulation system to use a multi  threaded parent process and child drone processes
communicating via shared memory, with functionalities separated into dedicated threads (collision detection and report generation), so that the
simulation runs step-by-step with robust synchronization using semaphores and can be terminated via signals when a collision
threshold is exceeded.
